# FPGA_Sandbox

This Repository will contain small side projects programmed in Verilog/VHDL (__TO BE DECIDED__)

I decided that i want't to learn about verilog programming, but every article/book tells you that
you should start with a small and simple fpga. So as yesterday was Prime day i decided to buy me
a GoWin TangPrimer 25k Board which will probably suit my beginner needs. As my book i will use
"Getting Started with FPGAs" from NoStarch i hope adapt the Projects to my choosen Board.

### Target Board

GoWin TangPrimer 25k

### Project structure

#### Docs

Will contain my notes about programming a fpga, also excerpts about the mentioned Book.

#### proj_???

Are the actual Projects and will contain all sources and other necessary stuff

All Projects will be developed in their own branches and then merged into main!
